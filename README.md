# Neural-Data-Analysis
Local Field Potential (electrical signals) filtered for ripples.
Ripples are localized oscillatory patterns  that occur in many neural networks.
They reflect a synchronizing mechanisms for coordinating ensembles of neurons within
distributed neural networks and for bringing neuronal aggregates within/across structures together in time (Buzsaki and Chrobak, 1995).
Ripples occur during exploratory behavior (rat in a linear track, open position). 
Those instances are times when the hippocampus receives rhythmic input from neurons.

# The Data
CRCNS.org hc3 data 
The CRCNS.org hc3 data set contains multiunit recordings from different rat hippocampal regions while
the animals were performing multiple behavioral tasks. There are 7736 cells in the data set. They were
recorded from 11 animals.  The data was obtained during 442 recording sessions. During each session the animal performed one of 14 behavioral tasks.  Ripples occur during exploratory behavior (rat in a linear track, open position, and rapid eye movement sleep)
I focused on sleeping but the code for detecting ripples can be applied to any of the exploratory behaviors.
